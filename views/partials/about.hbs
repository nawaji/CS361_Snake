		<p>
			SNAKE is about slithering your way towards apples to grow! The concept 
			originated from a 1976 two-player arcade game called Blockade, 
			from Gremlin Industries. Throughout the years, there's been a multitude 
			of SNAKE variations (including a version on the Nokia mobile phones in 1998!).

		<h1>CONTROLS</h1>
		<p>
			Use arrow keys to move your snake in a specific direction. You cannot do a 180 turn
			without doing two moves (i.e cannot go right when going left). You may also change to WASD
			controls through the "Options" panel if you like.
